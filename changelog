Calcolatrice_Java ver 2.0
  
  * minor improvement in layout:
	buttons order changed.
	display is no more editable.
	display is set to zero when Calculator appears.
	when * or / is pressed, the last number is shown instead of zero.
  * minor improvement in engine:
	when a digit is pressed after return, the computation restarts instead of appending that digit to the previous result.
	when dot is pressed after return, the computation restarts from 0. instead of appending the dot to the previous result.
	when dot is pressed more than one time, only the first is considered.
	when an illegal character is pressed it is ignored.
